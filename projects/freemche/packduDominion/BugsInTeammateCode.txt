Title:  adventurer card does not recognize gold or silver as treasure

Class:  Minor bug

Date:  28 Feb 2018
Reported By: Cheryl Freeman
Email:  freemche@oregonstate.edu

Product:  dominion.c, Version Assignment 2 branch from
https://github.com/Polemics/CS362-004-W2018.git

Platform:  
Linux version 3.10.0-693.11.1.el7.x86_64 (builder@kbuilder.dev.centos.org) (gcc version 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-16) (GCC) ) #1 SMP Mon Dec 4 23:52:40 UTC 2017

Is it reproducible?  Yes

Description:
When I draw a treasure card, after having played adventurer, it only
recognizes the card as a treasure if it is a copper.  Gold and silver
do not get recognized as treasure cards.

Steps to produce/reproduce:
---------------------------
Fill your deck with golds.
Play the adventurer card.
Start drawing from your deck.

Expected results:
---------------------------
After two golds are drawn, you should stop drawing because you have
two treasure cards.

Actual results:
---------------------------
You keep going through your deck until you have found two coppers,
or until you've looked at every card you have.

The same steps, expected results, and actual results apply with
silvers as with golds.

Workarounds:
---------------------------
None

Attachments:
---------------------------
None

Other information:
---------------------------
I think the bug is probably found in the logic statement for 
the cardDrawn in cardAdventurer.  I think it checks to see if
the card drawn is a copper, but then has something wonky in the
check for the card drawn being silver or gold.
Thanks so much for writing a fun game!  I really like to play it.  Hope you
get this fixed soon.

Title:  mine card allows me to upgrade from copper to gold

Class:  Minor bug

Date:  28 Feb 2018
Reported By: Cheryl Freeman
Email:  freemche@oregonstate.edu

Product:  dominion.c, Version Assignment 2 branch from
https://github.com/Polemics/CS362-004-W2018.git

Platform:  
Linux version 3.10.0-693.11.1.el7.x86_64 (builder@kbuilder.dev.centos.org) (gcc version 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-16) (GCC) ) #1 SMP Mon Dec 4 23:52:40 UTC 2017

Is it reproducible?  Yes

Description:
I play a mine card, which allows me to upgrade from one money level to the
next higher level (copper->silver, silver->gold).  But this bug allows me
to upgrade from copper->gold.

Steps to produce/reproduce:
---------------------------
Put a copper in your hand in position 0.
Play the mine card.
Choose to upgrade your copper to a gold.

Expected results:
---------------------------
You should be told no, or be given an error message, or be asked
to specify a card within 3 coins cost of the copper you are trashing.

Actual results:
---------------------------
Your hand now has a gold in it.

Workarounds:
---------------------------
None

Attachments:
---------------------------

Other information:
---------------------------
I think the problem probably lies in cardMine().  The check for the cost
of the chosen card is incorrect, because it checks for the cost of the
card you are trashing, and compares it with the cost of an incorrectly-
specified card (choice1).  What is happening, is that because you said
you wanted to trash the card in hand position 0, it looks up the cost of
card 0, which is curse (cost 0).  Anything you want to upgrade to is
affordable.
